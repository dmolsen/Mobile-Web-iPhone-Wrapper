You need to have the iPhone SDK installed which means you can only run
this on an Intel-based Mac. To get an idea of the final product check 
out the example on Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/dmolsen/4010595318/

Once you have that and you've grabbed a copy of the files (have no idea if
this project will work on other people's machines) do the following:

1. Open the project in XCode
2. Open the MobileWebAppDelegate.m file
3. Edit line #20 where it has http://m.wvu.edu to reflect your hostname
4. Click 'Build & Go'

Up should pop the iPhone Simulator with a generic logo, generic start-up screen,
a bit of white (a bug but normal) and then your site.

Again, this is a proof-of-concept and obviously isn't finished. Just an
interesting way to leverage your existing site while making it an iPhone app
for the iTunes App Store.
